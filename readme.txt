This is my first ever custom programming language, written circa January 2021.
The following is the original Readme

@ me if you need help
Operators + - * / %
Predefined functions: intin, lstin, out
Predefined variables: integer, list of integers
@ is a converter operator, converts an int to one long list of int and returns length of everything else
// for comments
variables.ral shows all the available override methods for custom operators
output.py is the code being run, look at it for debugging
There are some example.ral files you can look at to try and understand it
unicode characters here --> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters
good luck
run Converter.py then type the name of the .ral file you want to run (in the same directory, you could also specify the full path)
p.s. If it breaks for no reason make sure there is code within the braces and try changing variable names, the compiler may be misinterpreting it
for example exitCode will break it because the compiler will see it and think you typed exit
